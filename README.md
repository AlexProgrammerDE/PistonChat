**Advanced chat plugin for survival/anarchy servers.**

## About
This plugin was created to be a recreation of ChatCo from the ground up.
A lot of chat plugins usually don't get any updates anymore or have been abandoned by the developers. 

PistonChat will always get updates and contributions are welcome!

## Features
* Green Text
* Private Messaging
* Auto Complete when you click on a players name just like on the server 2b2t.org
* Ignore Commands
* Lots of features that 2b2t's chat plugin has.
