# PistonChat

**ðŸ’¬ Advanced chat plugin for survival/anarchy servers.**

## About

PistonChat is a recreation of the 2b2t.org chat plugin, but with many more features and options.
It is designed to be used on survival and anarchy servers, but can also be used on other types of servers.
Other options like ChatCo aren't up to date anymore and are not maintained, so I decided to create my own chat plugin.

PistonChat will always get updates and contributions are welcome!

## Features

* Green Text
* Private Messaging
* Auto Complete when you click on a players name just like on the server 2b2t.org
* Ignore Commands
* Lots of features that 2b2t's chat plugin has.
